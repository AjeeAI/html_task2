AWARENESS SECTION (A paragraph was required but you can reduce it if it's too long)

Drug abuse is when a temporary high steals your health, your money, and your future. One wrong hit today can hit your future forever. It happens when people use substances (like codeine, tramadol, cannabis, or alcohol) in a harmful way. 
Taking too much, taking without prescription, or using them to escape reality. It may feel good for a moment, but the long-term damage is heavy.

🚨 Why You Should Say No to Drugs (I added the icons for aesthetics. You may choose to remove them.)
Drug abuse may look like “fun” at first, but the damage is real and lasting:

- Health Destroys 🩺 → From lung damage to brain disorders, drugs silently eat away at your body.
- Dreams Delay 🎓 → Addiction makes it harder to focus in school, at work, or on your hustle.
- Pocket Drains 💸 → Drugs burn money faster than they burn stress, leaving you broke.
- Trouble Attracts 🚔 → Many youths end up in crime, gangs, or with police problems because of drug use.
- Life Cuts Short ⚰ → Overdoses and accidents take young lives every day.

Truth is: drugs don’t just waste your time, they waste your future.
